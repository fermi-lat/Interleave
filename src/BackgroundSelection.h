/** @class BackgroundSelection
    @brief manage the selection of background events to merge with signal events
    @author Dan Flath

It uses the name of a tuple variable as a key to look up trigger and downlink rates of a background
source depending on the value of that variable. See the corresponding member functions. Given such
a value, it expects to find a source of such events generated with that value which can be inserted 
into the Gleam output tuple.
